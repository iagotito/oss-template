# Welcome to Tiamat contributing guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project!

Read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community
approachable and respectable.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow
from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](README.md). Here
are some resources to help you get started with open source
contributions:

## Contributing

If you have a trivial fix or improvement, go ahead and create a pull
request.

If you plan to do something more involved, discuss your ideas on the
relevant GitHub issue.

If you noticed any problem or have an idea of new functionality, create
an issue about it.

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem or had an ideia, [search if an issue already
exists](link to issues).
If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue following
the apropriate [issue template](/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE)

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing
issues](link to issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow
down the search using `labels` as filters.

### Steps to contribute

To start your changes, first fork this repository and create a new
branch with a meaningful name related to the changes you intend to do.

#### Dependency management

> This should be different based on the used technology.

This project uses some external Python packages listed on the
`requirements.txt`. Use `pip` to install those dependencies:

```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

We recommend to use a [virtual
enviroment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to a better
dependency management.

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. See ours [commit
message guide](/.github/commit-message-guide.md) to know the best
pratices for commit messages.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also
known as a PR.

> TODO: a todo list to send the PR

### Your PR is merged!
